- Urine volume roughly matches consumed water
- Buffed most hydration values, so that a player only needs to drink roughly 3.75 liters of water per thirst bar
- Fixed kettle in firepit renderer bug (texture atlas was bleeding onto the kettle)
- "gaymer" color in client config makes rainbow pee
- Player now loses hydration from the start
- Adjusted calabash transform and drying rate
- Added calabash wine and brandy, (+ dehydrated calabash for expanded foods)
- Added zh-cn translation (thanks to MystiVaid) (including new items)
- Removed pure water underground spawns (now only in rivers), in preparation for changes to dowsing mechanics
- Fixed clay kettle absorbing surrounding light when placed
- Dynamic water purity allocation based on location (river, altitude, temperature, soil fertility, forest density)
- NOTE: I want to transition to an attribute based system for water, which will reduce the number of water types,
and allow all water types to be used in recipes from other mods. However, I couldn't do it all in one go. Currently,
the custom water types cannot be used in recipes. This won't be a problem when I complete the switch, but in the meantime,
I adopted a stopgap solution: containes have tool modes, allowing players to choose whether they want the purer water type,
or to pick dirtier vanilla water. This will not be possible with sources that give stagnant water, but it will be with all other water types,
giving a source of water for recipes that require it. This is a temporary solution, and will be removed when the attribute system is implemented.
